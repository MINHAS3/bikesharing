# NYC Citi Bike Analysis 
The analysis of the Citi Bike ride is that there are various riders that utilize 
the cities bike station both male and females use it making it easier to 
commute through the traffic in NYC, especially in the major of bourrough of Manhattan. 
This bourrough connects other bourroughs in the city. The bike share won't be a good to have a smaller
city like Des Monies because it is a smaller sity. Even though the city has lots to attractions in a smaller that 
is less densely populated the bike share won't be cost efficent. Logistics of where to put bike stations, 
how far they will be from one another, amount of tourist each year. 
The bike share program will work best in a bigger city versus a smaller city.
